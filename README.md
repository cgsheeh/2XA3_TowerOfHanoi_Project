# SFWR 2XA3 - Towers of Hanoi

This repository contains source code for the "Towers of Hanoi" final project in SFWR 2XA3 at McMaster University.

The project was to code a recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem using NASM assembly code, meeting several requirements.

The solution must use arrays, be assembled with a makefile and use of several provided libraries was permitted.

The class (SFWR 2XA3) was an experiential learning course in Unix, Bash, NASM and command line tools.

To use, run

```
$ ./hantow <num>
```

on a Unix machine, where ```<num>``` is an integer from 2-8. The program will print the solution to the problem in the console.

Of all files in this repo, only hantow.asm and makefile were coded by myself. The rest were provided by the professor.
